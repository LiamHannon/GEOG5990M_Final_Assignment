# To what extent does an ageing population affect house prices in Leeds?
## Introduction and aims

An increasing ageing population is a new phenomenon that the world is facing in the 21st century characterised by low fertility rates, decreasing late-life mortality, and increasing migration (Harper and Leeson, 2008). it is estimated that by 2050, people aged 60 and over will double to over 2 billion (WHO, 2022, Harper and Leeson, 2008). This brings with it many implications, some positive such as increasing productivity in some countries (Healy, 2024) and some negative, such as an increase in informal caregiving (Ratcliffe et al., 2012). In this study, the focus is on the relationship that an ageing population has on house prices, more specifically in the Leeds area of the UK. 

The effect that ageing has on real estate and land prices can be seen more obviously in Japan because Japan has the fastest-growing rate of ageing population out of any developed country in the world (Saita et al., 2016). The findings by Saita et al. (2016) were that an ageing population has a negative effect on house prices in Japan. Tak√°ts (2012) also found in their study of 22 advanced economies that ageing will decrease house prices by around 80 basis points per year. A third study in Australia concurs with these results, whereby ageing could affect property prices negatively by up to 27% over 2008-2050 (Guest and Swift, 2010).

The aims of this study are to establish first the average percentage per year differences between house prices and ageing separately. This derives the general trend of both datasets and creates averages for each LSOA in Leeds. These two results are then correlated to show their relationship to one another, with a respective r value which derives the strength of correlation. The final aim is to map where in Leeds there is a large increasing ageing population and where there is a low or even negative ageing population.

The intended audience is the general public and business owners in Leeds who are looking to purchase property. This would help them make an informed decision as to where in Leeds would be sensible to purchase property assets given the relationship between ageing and property prices.
